# Word-Stats
This is a discord bot to track modern language usage using the Discord messaging platform.
My original intention was to have this work with another Discord bot that I co-own called Word-Tracker created by TacticalGubbins.
Word-Stats would allow you to see how many times you use each word and giving you a visual representation of what this would look like. 
It would also provide a graph of the most commonly used words used by everybody on the platfrom with this Discord bot in their server.
I originally came up with this idea as an experiment to see how people comunicate over Discord and see changing language use over time.
